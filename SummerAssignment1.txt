C++/SFML Assignments

Over the summer, I'll be assigning game development tasks for those students who
want to improve their skills in C++ game development using SFML. Feel free to
participate or not, as you wish (unless I've already indicated that you must do
them).
 

The first assignment is intended to get you to exercise your knowledge of C++,
and get going with the SFML library.

The assignment is to re-implement the classic game of Pong using C++ and SFML.
This game of Pong must:

* have a scoreboard
* be able to restart once one player wins
* make a sound when the ball hits the paddle, and a different sound when the ball
 leaves the playfield
* have different angles of reflection depending on where the ball hits the
 paddle, as in the original.


I'd also like you to pick a non-standard feature, and add that to the game.
Examples are:

* multiple paddles for each player
* a gravity black hole in the middle of the playfield
* creature in the middle that will eat the ball
etc.

Once you're done, make a gameplay video and post it on Youtube, and make a
GitHub account and upload your code to GitHub. Post final YouTube link and
GitHub links in the comments/feedback below this post.

Note that there is an example Pong game in the SFML distribution. You are free
to look at this, but I would really like people to implement this game from
scratch, since the goal is to develop proficiency with C++ and SFML.

You should aim for completing this assignment by July 19.

Make it so players battle it out with top and bottom action so one player uses
